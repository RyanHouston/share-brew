Started by Ryan Houston on August 4, 2010

== Overview ==
ShareBrew aims to provide a space for beer homebrewers to store and share
 their recipes. Brewers will have the ability to record details for each
 batch they brew. This will allow for reflection on the brewing process
 and changes to a recipe from batch to batch which will result in better
 tasting beer and a deeper understanding of how changes in recipe and
 brewing process effect the end product.

== Current Status ==
This project is a work in progress.

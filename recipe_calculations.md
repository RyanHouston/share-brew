Recipe Calculations
===================

Calculating the Malt Bill
-------------------------
Original Gravity of recipe = total recipe gravity / batch size in gallons

total recipe gravity in GUs = sum(GUs per fermentable)

GUs per fermentable = gravity per lb. X weight in lbs
- This is the number of gravity units (GUs) for that particular fermentable.

Gravity per lb. = (extract potential X mash efficiency)

extract potential
  provided by the maltster for each malt. Tables with average values for most popular malts exist for this in various places.

mash efficiency
  calculated from results of previous brewing sessions on a particular brewing rig. An average to start with if there is no known efficiency for the brewhouse is 65%.
